## HAS-A Relation Assosiation:
It represents the connection between two classes via one or more objects.
Example: The object "Aminal" HAS A heart.

## Aggregation:
Association is a relation between two separate classes which establishes through their Objects. Association can be one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, many-to-many.
Example: The object "Animal" has a owner

## Composition:
A composition in Java between two objects associated with each other. Other classes cannot exist without the parent class.
Example: A "Animal" class is a composition of Legs and Ears. When the animal object dies, lega and ears can't exist on their own.

## Assosiation vs Aggregation vs Composition:
A Association can be divided into aggregation and composition.
An aggregation class can have an independent existence.
A composition class cannot exist if the container class is destroyed or removed.
