## Delegation
Our Program class has the function to delegate the order and actions of the other classes.
Itself is just starting method after method without beeing itself a logic component.

## Encapsulation
Is a mechanism of wrapping data and code together as a single unit.
In encapsulation, informations inside of a class will be hidden from other classes,
and can be accessed only through the methods of their current class.

## Information Hiding
Information hiding is a design principle, where some (or all) aspects of a
program are inaccessible to users.
The primary idea is to prevent modification to users 
whenever the details of a  program are changed.

## Getter and Setter
Through Getters and Setters it is possible to gain acces to data from privat fields.
Our class Beer has private fields with informations. These are assesable through the getters and setter at
the bottom of the class.
